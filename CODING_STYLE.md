# Coding Style

## Variables
* UPPER_SNAKE_CASE for globals
* snake_case for stack

## Functions
* Names of functions and parameters are snake_case
* Function parameters should always have annotations (except for abstract methods)

## Classes
* Class names are UperCamelCase
* Class methods and attributes are lowerCamelCase
* Protected members (things you better should not tamper with) are underscored _lowerCamelCase
* Private members (things you definitely not tamper with) are \_\_double_underscored\_\_
